			<p>I am passionate about culture and digital technologies. My expertise lies in bringing both areas together in a meaningful way. In recent years, I have worked on applying visualisation techniques to cultural collection data and on exploring interaction concepts in the context of digital research approaches in the humanities and museum interpretation with a specific focus on Human-AI Collaboration. <br /><br />My work is guided by the conviction that digital technologies offer the potential to re-think and re-configure research and practices in the humanities and in cultural institutions, allow us to implement critical and interventionist approaches, and strengthen visitor orientation and accessibility in museums. I believe in the value of collaboration and enjoy working with colleagues from different disciplines, which regularly challenges me to explore new practices and methods. The strongest influences on my academic and applied work have come from fields such as design, human-centred computing, and critical cartography. <br /><br />My dissertation <a href="https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/items/93977c09-302e-4d2a-bd79-ea3d0ade955d" target="_blank">»Festgeschrieben - Cultural-technical manifestations of museum collection orders and transformative effects of digital technologies«</a> is concerned with the institutionalised form of collecting in European museums. I analyse the effects of digital socio-technical systems in museum collection documentation, especially regarding knowledge representation. For this, I combine a theoretical approach grounded in cultural studies with a practice-oriented perspective informed by critical museology, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and visualisation research. Conclusively, I address the question of whether and in what way digital socio-technical systems and algorithmic processes can amplify or trigger »transformative impulses« in the context of museum collecting. <br /><br />In October 2025 I joined <a href="https://www.f5.htw-berlin.de/" target="_blank">the School of Culture and Design</a> at Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft (HTW) Berlin where I am professor for <i>Digital Museum Documentation and Transformation Management</i> in the study programs <i>Museum Studies and Museum Management &amp; Communication</i>.
