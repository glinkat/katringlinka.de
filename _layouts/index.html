			<h2>Culture &amp; Digitisation</h2><br class="large-breaks" />
			<p>„My work focuses on digital technologies, museum collections, spatial knowledge and social practices. My dissertation on »Structures of Similarity - Representation and Reference in Digital Collections« examines differences and similarities between concepts, terminologies, and methods in computer science, art history, and museum practice. In recent years I have regularly given lectures, organised workshops and published articles &amp; conference papers on various topics. I am especially interested in digitisation and visualisation in the cultural field and its means and potential for curating, the implementation of critical and interventionist approaches to mediation, and visitor orientation in museums. As scientific project lead for the project »museum4punkt0« at the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz, I developed and evaluated various digital applications for museums. Before that, I worked as a research associate at the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences, where I continue to teach media and design theory. I completed my master's degree at Leuphana University Lüneburg and am currently a doctoral candidate at the Humboldt University of Berlin.“</p>
