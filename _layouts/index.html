			<p>I am passionate about culture and digital technologies. My expertise lies in bringing both areas together in a meaningful way. In recent years, I have especially worked on applying visualisation techniques to cultural data and on exploring interaction concepts in the context of digital research approaches in the humanities and museum interpretation. <br /><br />My work is guided by the conviction that digital technologies offer the potential to re-think and re-configure research and practices in the humanities and in cultural institutions, allow us to implement critical and interventionist approaches, and strengthen visitor orientation and accessibility in museums. I believe in the value of collaboration and enjoy working with colleagues from different disciplines, which regularly challenges me to explore new practices and methods. The strongest influences on my academic and applied work have come from fields such as design, human-centered computing, and critical cartography. <br /><br />My dissertation on »Cultural-technical manifestations of museum collection orders and transformative effects of digital technologies« is concerned with the institutionalized form of collecting in European museums. Specifically, I analyze the effects of using digital socio-technical systems for documenting museum collections, especially in relation to knowledge representation. I combine a theoretical approach grounded in cultural studies with a practice-oriented perspective informed by critical museology, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and visualization research. I address the question of whether and in what way digital socio-technical systems and algorithmic processes can amplify or trigger »transformative impulses« in the context of museum collecting. <br /><br />In November 2020, I joined the Human-Centered Computing Research Group at Freie Universität Berlin as head of the <a href="https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/hcc_data_lab/index.html">HCC Data Lab</a> As the scientific project lead for the project <a href="https://www.museum4punkt0.de/">museum4punkt0</a> (2017 - 2020) at the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz I developed and evaluated various digital applications for museums. Before that, I was a research associate at the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences where I continued to teach media and design theory until spring 2020.
