			<h2>Culture &amp; Digitisation</h2><br class="large-breaks" />
			<p>I am passionate about <strong>culture and digital technologies</strong>. My expertise lies in bringing both areas together in a meaningful way. In recent years, I have especially worked on applying <strong>visualisation techniques</strong> to cultural data and on exploring innovative digital approaches to <strong>museum interpretation</strong>. <br /><br/>My work is guided by the conviction that digital technologies offer the potential to re-think and re-configure the practice of curating, allow us to implement critical and interventionist approaches, and strengthen visitor orientation and accessibility in museums. I believe in the value of collaboration and enjoy working with colleagues from different disciplines, which regularly challenges me to explore new practices and methods. The strongest influences on my academic and applied work have come from fields such as design, human-centered computing, and critical cartography. <br /><br />In my dissertation, I examine differences and similarities between concepts, terminologies, and methods in computer science, art history, and museum practice. In my thesis I analyse, among other things, the influence of machine learning methods on the cultural practice of collecting and documenting in museums. As the scientific project lead for the project "museum4punkt0" at the Stiftung Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz I developed and evaluated various digital applications for museums. Before that, I was a research associate at the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences, where I also continue to teach media and design theory.</p>
